title: SMT Solver
type: category

An SMT solver is an implementation of algorithms that solve a [[uses: Logical Formula]] of [[uses: First Order Logic]]. Since FOL is more complex, these solvers are generalizing the Boolean Satisfiability Problem that a [[uses: Satisfiability Solver]] solves. In fact, SMT solvers often have higher level theory solvers specialized to the theory, and SAT solvers which solve the underlying [[uses: Propositional Logic]] constraints, called the [[uses: Boolean Skeleton]].
