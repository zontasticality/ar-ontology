**Implicational Intuitionistic Propositional Logic (IIPL)** is an incredibly simple [[is-a:formal logic]] wherein logical sentences are constructed using [[uses:propositional variable|propositional variables]] combined with only one connective: [[uses:logical implication]].
 - [[uses:Logical implication]]: $A \rightarrow B$

It is equivalent to the [[equivalent:simply typed lambda calculus]] via the [[mention:Curry-Howard Correspondence]] where every proposition and proof in IPL corresponds to a type and term in STLC.
