title: Feasibility of Program Inference
type: argument

The [[uses:Curry-Howard Correspondence]] establishes that programs are proofs and types are propositions. This suggests that techniques developed for automated theorem proving and finding proofs in logical systems, such as [[uses:Satisfiability Solver|SAT/SMT solvers]], could potentially be adapted to automatically finding or synthesizing programs that inhabit given [[uses:Type Theory|types]] (i.e., satisfy type specifications).
