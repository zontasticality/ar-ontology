title: Logical Framework
type: structure
---

A logical framework provides the foundational rules and syntax for constructing formal logical systems. It defines the kinds of [[uses:Logical Formula|formulae]] that can be built, the available logical connectives and quantifiers, and the rules of inference that determine valid deductions.

Examples include [[uses:Propositional Logic]], Predicate Logic, and various modal or temporal logics. Each framework allows reasoning about different kinds of statements and structures.
