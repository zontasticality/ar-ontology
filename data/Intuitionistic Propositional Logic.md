**Intuitionistic Propositional Logic (IPL)** is a [[is-a:logical framework]] that is a variant of [[mentions:propositional logic]] where the [[mention:law of the excluded middle]] is not assumed as an axiom. IPL is an instance of [[uses:Implicational Intuitionistic Propositional Logic]] with the following additional constructions:

 - [[uses:True]]: $\top$
 - [[uses:False]]: $\bot$
 - [[uses:Logical Conjunction]]: $A \land B$
 - [[uses:Logical Disjunction]]: $A \lor B$
 - [[uses:Logical Negation]]: $\neg A$

In IPL, a proposition is considered true only if there is a constructive proof for it. This means that to prove a statement or formula, one must provide a direct construction or evidence of its truth, rather than relying on the impossibility of its negation.

IPL is closely related to [[mentions:simply typed lambda calculus]] via the [[mention:Curry-Howard Correspondence]], where proofs in IPL correspond to terms in STLC and propositions correspond to types.
