**Intuitionistic Propositional Logic (IPL)** is a [[is-a:logical framework]] wherein logical sentences are constructed using [[uses:propositional variable|propositional variables]] combined with the following connectives, modifiers and constants:
 - [[uses:True]]: $\top$
 - [[uses:False]]: $\bot$
 - [[uses:Logical negation]]: $\neg A$
 - [[uses:Logical conjunction]]: $A \land B$
 - [[uses:Logical disjunction]]: $A \lor B$
 - [[uses:Logical implication]]: $A \rightarrow B$

It is equivalent to the [[equivalent:simply typed lambda calculus]] via the [[mention:Curry-Howard Correspondence]] where every proposition and proof in IPL corresponds to a type and term in STLC.
