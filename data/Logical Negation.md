type: structure

Logical negation is a unary [[is-a:function|operation]] that reverses the truth value of a proposition. In [[uses:Propositional Logic]], the negation of a formula $A$, written $\lnot A$, is [[uses:True]] if $A$ is [[uses:False]], and [[uses:False]] if $A$ is [[uses:True]].

The truth table for logical negation is:
| A     | Â¬A    |
| :---- | :---- |
| True  | False |
| False | True  |
