title: Rule of Inference
type: structure

A **Rule of Inference** is clearly defined rule for drawing a conclusion from a set of premises. Every [[uses:formal system]] has a deductive system as a part of its [[uses:formal grammar]] that consists of rules of inference that allow us to take an [[uses:axiom]] and derive a [[uses:theorem]]. 

For an example of inference rules, see the typing rules of the [[mention:simply typed lambda calculus]].
