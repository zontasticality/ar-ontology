A Theorem is [[is-a:Well-Formed Formula]] that can be constructed according to the [[part:Rule of Inference]] (plural) of a [[mentions: Formal System]], and therefore can be reached by logical deduction. 

There are well-formed formulas that cannot be theorems because they are not provable within the system; they may be true or false. 

For instance, in [[mentions:Propositional Logic]], the [[mentions:Logical Formula]] P OR NOTP, known as the Law of Excluded Middle, is a Theorem because it can be derived from the [[uses:Axiom]] (plural).
