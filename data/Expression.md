title: Expression
type: structure

An **expression** or **term** is a kind of [[is-a:well-formed formula]], usually used in the context of programming languages and [[part:type theory]]. Expressions can represent a value to be computed, a computation process itself, or a proof of some statement. They can be assigned [[uses:Type|types]], and are what inhabit types.

### Examples:
- In [[uses:lambda calculus]]: $x$, $Î»x.x$, $(f a)$
- In arithmetic: $x + 5$, $(y * 2) - z$
- In a programming language: $\text{add}(\text{arg1}, \text{arg2})$. $a + b$
