A function is a mapping between two sets, a domain and a codomain, such that every element in the domain is associated with exactly one element in the codomain.

Functions can be specified in various ways, including explicit formulas, algorithms, or tables of values. Some functions can't be specified or computed, for those that do see: [[mention:Computable Function]].
