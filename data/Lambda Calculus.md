Lambda calculus (λ-calculus) is a [[is-a:formal language]] for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.

It is a universal [[is-a:Model of Computation]], equivalent in power to [[mention:Turing Machine|Turing machines]].

The lambda calculus can be thought of as a [[is-a:data type]] with the following variants:
 - variables
 - abstractions λx.M
 - applications M N
