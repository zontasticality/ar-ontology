Lambda calculus (λ-calculus) is a [[is-a:well-formed formula]] in some [[mention:formal grammar]] that encodes computation using function abstraction, variable binding, application, and substitution.

It is a universal [[is-a:Model of Computation]], equivalent in power to [[mention:Turing Machine|Turing machines]].

The lambda calculus can also be encode as a [[is-a:data type]] with the following variants:
 - variables
 - abstractions λx.M
 - applications M N
