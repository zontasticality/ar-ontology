A **predicate** is a symbol in predicate logic and its supersets (such as [[uses:first order logic]]) that represents a property of objects or a relation among objects. It can be thought of as a [[is-broadly:Function|function]] that maps tuples of objects to a truth value ([[uses:True]] or [[uses:False]]).

- A predicate with one argument (a unary predicate) expresses a property. For example, $\text{Human}(x)$ could mean "$x$ is human."
- A predicate with two arguments (a binary predicate) expresses a relation between two objects. For example, $\text{Loves}(x, y)$ could mean "$x$ loves $y$."
- A predicate with $n$ arguments (an $n$-ary predicate) expresses a relation among $n$ objects.

When the variables in a predicate are instantiated with specific objects from a domain, the predicate becomes a proposition that is either true or false. For example, if $\text{Socrates}$ is an object in the domain, $\text{Human}(\text{Socrates})$ is a proposition.

Predicates are fundamental building blocks for constructing [[uses:Logical Formula|logical formulas]] in predicate logic. They are combined with [[mention:Quantifier|quantifiers]] and logical connectives to make assertions about domains of discourse, this combination of predicates, quantifiers, and some other things results in [[uses:First Order Logic]].
