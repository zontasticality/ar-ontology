title: Logical Disjunction
type: structure

Logical disjunction is a logical connective typically meaning "or". In [[uses:Propositional Logic]], the disjunction of two formulae $A$ and $B$, written $A \lor B$, is [[uses:True]] if at least one of $A$ or $B$ is true, and [[uses:False]] otherwise.

The truth table for logical disjunction is:
| A     | B     | A âˆ¨ B |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| True  | True  | True  |
| True  | False | True  |
| False | True  | True  |
| False | False | False |
