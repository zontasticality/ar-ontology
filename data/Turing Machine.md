A Turing machine is a mathematical [[is-a:Model of Computation]] that defines an abstract machine manipulating symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. A Turing machine can simulate any computer program.

It consists of an infinite tape divided into cells, a head that can read/write symbols and move, a state register, and a finite table of instructions.
