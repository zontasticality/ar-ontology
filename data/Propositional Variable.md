A **propositional variable** (or sentence letter) is a kind of [[subtype:variable]] and a basic element in [[uses:propositional logic]]. It represents an atomic propositionâ€”a statement that can be [[uses:assignment|assigned]] either [[uses:true]] or [[uses:false]].

In [[uses:Propositional Formula|propositional formulae]], they are often represented by single letters like $p, q, r, A, B$. An [[uses:assignment]] maps propositional variables to truth values.
