A propositional variable (or sentence letter) is a basic element in [[uses:Propositional Logic]]. It represents an atomic propositionâ€”a statement that can be either be assigned as [[uses:True]] or [[uses:False]].

In [[uses:Propositional Formula|propositional formulae]], they are often represented by single letters like $p, q, r, A, B$. An [[uses:Assignment]] maps propositional variables to truth values.
