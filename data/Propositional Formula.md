title: Propositional Formula
type: structure 
---

A propositional formula is a type of [[is-a:logical formula]] that uses symbols to express the framework of [[uses:propositional logic]].

For the purposes of this ontology, we will use the same symbols that have been used in class.

 - [[Uses:Propositional variable|Propositional variables]] are represented by single-letter names.
 - [[Uses:Logical conjunction]] of two sub-formulae is represented by $A \land B$, where $A$ and $B$ are any valid propositional formulae.
 - [[Uses:Logical disjunction]] of two sub-formulae is represented by $A \lor B$, where $A$ and $B$ are any valid propositional formulae.
 - Not $\lnot A$
 - Xor $A \oplus B$
 - Implies $A \rightarrow B$
 - True $\top$
 - False $\bot$
