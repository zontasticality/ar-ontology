A First Order Logic (FOL) is a [[is-a:Logical Framework]] that builds on [[uses:PropositionalLogic]] in the sense that it includes variables in the way that PL includes propositions, or [[uses:Propositional Variable]], but also includes [[uses:Predicates]] and, [[uses:Quantifiers]]. FOL collectively is an umbrella term for many theories such as Integer Arithmetic, Real Arithmetic, Bit-Vector, Array, and Set Theory. 

This node is closely related to [[uses: Theory]].
