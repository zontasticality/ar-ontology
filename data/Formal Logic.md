A **Formal Logic** is a [[is-a: Formal System]] that provides the foundational syntax and [[part:rule of inference|rules of inference]] for constructing a logical system and their associated [[uses:Logical Formula|formulae]].

Examples include [[uses:Propositional Logic]], Predicate Logic, also referred to as [[uses:First Order Logic]] and various modal or temporal logics. Each logic allows reasoning about different kinds of statements and structures.
