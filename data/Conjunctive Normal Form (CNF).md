Conjunctive normal form is a specific constraint on the structure of a [[is-broadly:logical formula]], often specifically referring to a [[is-a:propositional formula]].

A formula in CNF is a [[uses:Logical Conjunction|conjunction]] of clauses, where each clause is a [[uses:Logical Disjunction|disjunction]] of [[uses:propositional literal|propositional literals]].
