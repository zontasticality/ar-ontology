title: Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
type: structure
---

Conjunctive normal form is a specific constraint on the structure of a [[subtype:logical formula]], often more specifically referring to a [[subtype:propositional formula]].

In conjunctive normal form (commonly referred to as CNF) the formula takes the form of a [[uses:logical conjunction]] of a sequence of [[uses:logical disjunction|logical disjunctions]] of propositional literals.
