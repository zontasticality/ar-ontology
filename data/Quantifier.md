A **quantifier** is a construction defined by an [[is-a:rule of inference|inference rule]] that specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse satisfy a proposition or property. Quantifiers bind variables in a formula, turning an open [[uses:Logical Formula|formula]] (which has a free variable and thus no definite truth value) into a formula that has a definite truth value (assuming all variables are bound).

The most common quantifiers are:
-   **[[uses:Universal Quantifier|Universal Quantifier]]** ($\forall$): "for all" or "given any".
-   **[[uses:Existential Quantifier|Existential Quantifier]]** ($\exists$): "there exists" or "for some".

## In the wild

Quantifiers are essential components of [[uses:First Order Logic]], and higher order logics as well.
