type: structure

A **pushdown automaton** (PDA) is a type of [[uses:finite automaton]] that employs a stack in addition to finite state control. It is a [[is-a:Model of Computation]] more capable than uses:finite automata but less capable than [[uses:Turing Machine|Turing machines]].

A defining property of pushdown automaton are that they are the weakest Model of Computation capable of recognizing [[uses:Context-Free Grammar|context-free languages]].
