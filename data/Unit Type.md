The unit type, denoted as $\top$, `()`, `Unit`, or `1`, is a [[is-a:type]] that has exactly one canonical value (often written as `()`, `unit`, or `*`). It conveys no information beyond its own existence, similar to a void return type in some programming languages but representing a type with a single, trivial value rather than no value at all.

Under the [[uses:Curry-Howard Correspondence]], the unit type corresponds directly to [[equivalent:True|the proposition that is always true]]. Just as the proposition [[equivalent:True]] has a trivial, universally available proof, the unit type has a single, unique inhabitant that can always be constructed. Set-theoretically it can be thought of as the singleton set.
