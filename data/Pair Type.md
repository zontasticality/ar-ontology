A **pair type**, denoted as $A \times B$ or `Pair A B`, represents a value that is a pair of values, one of type $A$ and one of type $B$. Values of a pair type are typically constructed using a pairing operation (e.g., `(a, b)` where `a` is of type A and `b` is of type B).

Logically via the [[mention:Curry-Howard Correspondence]] pair types can be interpreted as $A \land B$ or [[equivalent:logical conjunction]], meaning to prove $A \land B$ you need a proof of both $A$ and $B$. Set-theoretically it can be interpreted as the cartesian product of sets $A$ and $B$. In category theory pair types correspond to products.
