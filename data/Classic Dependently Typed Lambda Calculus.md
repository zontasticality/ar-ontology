A **Classic Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus (CDTLC)** refers to a [[is-broadly:Type Theory]] that extends a [[part:Martin-Lof Type Theory|dependently-typed lambda calculus]] with some axiom that embodies the [[mention:Law of the Excluded Middle]], such as the `call/cc` operator. It can be seen either a classical extension of a dependently typed lambda calculus, or as a dependently typed extension of a [[part:classically typed lambda calculus]].

When adding classical axioms, DTLC (now CDTLC) becomes equivalent in some sense to [[equivalence:First Order Logic]] via the [[mention:Curry-Howard Correspondence]]. Under this equivalence propositions in classical First Order Logic correspond to types in CDTLC, and classical proofs correspond to terms in CDTLC.

This allows for the formalization of classical mathematics and reasoning within a typed lambda calculus framework, potentially leveraging the computational interpretations of proofs, though the constructive nature of evidence found in intuitionistic systems cannot be expected universally.
