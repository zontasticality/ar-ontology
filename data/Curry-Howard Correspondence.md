title: Curry-Howard Correspondence
type: argument
---
The Curry-Howard correspondence (also known as the Curry-Howard isomorphism or the proofs-as-programs paradigm) proposes some kind of relation between [[uses:Formal Logic|logical frameworks]] and [[uses:type theory|type theories]].

It establishes a direct correspondence between:
 - Propositions and Types: A logical proposition corresponds to a type in some type theory.
 - Proofs and Programs: A proof of a proposition corresponds to a program of the corresponding type.
 - Proof Simplification and Program Evaluation: The process of simplifying a proof (cut elimination) corresponds to the process of evaluating a program ($\beta$-reduction).
