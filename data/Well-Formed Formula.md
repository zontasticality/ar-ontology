type: structure

A well-formed formula of an associated [[uses:formal grammar]] is a [[uses:list|sequence]] of symbols for which the associated classifying function of that grammar returns true.

Note:

While "well-formed formula" (WFF) is a general term, specific kinds of WFFs in different domains often have more common names. For instance, in programming and [[mention:Type Theory|type theory]], WFFs that represent programs or computational units are frequently called *terms* or *expressions*. In [[mention:Formal Logic|logic]], WFFs that represent statements are typically referred to as *propositions* or *formulas*.
