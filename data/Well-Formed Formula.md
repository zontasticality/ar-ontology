type: structure

A well-formed formula of an associated [[uses:context-free]] [[uses:language]], is a [[uses:String|sequence of symbols]] for which the associated [[mentions:classifying function]] of that language returns true.

This can also be stated less formally as: A well-formed formula is a sequence of symbols that is valid ("well-formed") according to some formal grammar.

Examples might include a syntactically valid piece of code, a numerical expression, or a [[mentions:logical formula]].
