title: Model of Computation

A model of computation is a formal, mathematical abstraction of computation. It defines a set of allowable operations and their effects, specifying how outputs are derived from inputs.

Different models capture different aspects or levels of computational power. Common examples include [[mention:finite automaton|finite automata]], [[mention:pushdown automata]], [[mention:Turing Machine|turing machines]], and [[uses:Lambda Calculus|lambda calculi]]. Many models, like Turing machines and lambda calculus, are equivalent in power (Turing-complete) and define the limits of what is theoretically [[uses:Computable Function|computable]].
