**Function types**, denoted as $A \rightarrow B$, represent functions that take an argument of type $A$ and return a result of type $B$.

Logically via the [[mention:Curry-Howard Correspondence]] function types can be interpreted as $A \rightarrow B$ or [[equivalent:logical implication]], meaning to prove $A \rightarrow B$ you need a proof that given a proof of $A$ you can construct a proof of $B$. Set-theoretically it can be interpreted as the set of functions from set $A$ to set $B$. In category theory function types correspond to exponential objects.
