A type is a core component of a [[uses:type theory]] that classifies data or expressions based on their properties and the operations that can be performed on them.

For example, the type Nat, representing all natural numbers, constrains the possible values of a variable with type Nat. For instance, if one is given some variable $x$ of type Nat, one can be sure that $x$ will not be the string "hello, world", etc.

In this way, types are used to prevent errors by ensuring that operations are applied to data of the appropriate kind.

Examples include [[uses:data type|data types]], [[uses:boolean|booleans]], and [[uses:function type|function types]].
