A type is a core part of a [[uses:Type Theory]] that classifies data or expressions based on their properties and the operations that can be performed on them.

Types are used to prevent errors by ensuring that operations are applied to data of the appropriate kind.

Examples include [[uses:Data Type]], [[uses:Boolean]], and [[uses:Function]].
