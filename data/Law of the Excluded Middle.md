title: Law of the Excluded Middle

The law of the excluded middle (LEM) is an (optional) axiom in [[uses:Formal Logic|logic]] presupposes that there is no "3rd value" between any proposition $A$ or $\neg A$.

Formally, it can be expressed as:

$A \lor \neg A$

This principle is a key difference between [[mentions:intuitionistic propositional logic]] and [[mentions:propositional logic]].
