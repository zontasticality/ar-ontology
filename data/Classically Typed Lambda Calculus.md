title: Classically Typed Lambda Calculus
type: structure
---
The **classically typed lambda calculus (CTLC)** is the [[is-a:intuitionistically-typed lambda calculus]] together with an operator called `call/cc`  or `call-with-current-continuation` which enables control flow manipulation and also just happens to correspond to the [[mention:law of the excluded middle]].

Due to the addition of LEM, CTLC directly to [[equivalent:propositional logic]] via the [[mention:Curry-Howard Correspondence]].
