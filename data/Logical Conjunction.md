title: Logical Conjunction
type: structure

Logical conjunction is a [[is-alogical connective]] typically meaning "and". In [[uses:Propositional Logic]], the conjunction of two formulae $A$ and $B$, written $A \land B$, is [[uses:True]] if and only if both $A$ and $B$ are true; it is [[uses:False]] otherwise.

The truth table for logical conjunction is:
| A     | B     | A âˆ§ B |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| True  | True  | True  |
| True  | False | False |
| False | True  | False |
| False | False | False |
