In logic, an **assignment** (or valuation, interpretation) is a [[is-broadly:function]] that maps [[uses:variable|variables]] within a given [[uses:logical formula]] to values.

For example, in [[mentions:propositional logic]], [[mentions:propositional variable|propositional variables]] are mapped to truth values of [[uses:true]] or [[uses:false]].

Assignments can be used to evaluate the truth value of a complex formula. A [[mention:satisfying assignment]] is one that makes a formula evaluate to [[mention:true]].
