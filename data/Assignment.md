In logic, an assignment (or valuation, interpretation) is a [[is-a:function]] that maps [[uses:Propositional Variable|propositional variables]] within a given [[uses:logical formula]] to truth values ([[uses:true]] or [[uses:false]]).

Assignments are used to determine the truth value of a complex formula based on the truth values of its constituent variables. A [[mentions:Satisfying Assignment]] is one that makes a formula evaluate to [[mention:True]].
