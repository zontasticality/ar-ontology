type: concept
---
A Type theory is a [[is-a: Formal System]] that is an alternative to [[equivalent: Logical Framework]]that provides a formal system for classifying and reasoning about [[uses: Types]]. It is a foundational theory in computer science and logic, used to define the structure of data and the behavior of programs.

Type theory is a generalization of [[uses:type|types]] in programming languages, and is used to prevent errors by ensuring that operations are applied to data of the appropriate kind.
