type: concept

Type theory is an alternative to [[equivalent:logical framework|logical frameworks]] that provide a formal system for classifying and reasoning about types. It is a foundational theory in computer science and logic, used to define the structure of data and the behavior of programs.

Type theory is a generalization of [[uses:type|types]] in programming languages, and is used to prevent errors by ensuring that operations are applied to data of the appropriate kind.
